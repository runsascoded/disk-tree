"""Adaptive range-splitting bulk listing (spec: adaptive-listing.md).

The pre-planned sharding in :mod:`disk_tree.find.bulk` needs either prior
weights (``-W``) or directory-ish fanout at depth ≤ 2 — a first scan of a
bucket whose keys bury their fanout deep (marin's ``datakit/`` holds 78% of
92.7M keys) degenerates to one serial pagination chain: ~1000 keys/page ×
1 RTT/page, hours of wall clock regardless of worker count.

Here workers own key **ranges** ``[start, end)`` instead of prefixes, and the
splitting is *self-donation* rather than coordinated stealing: every worker
that is ≥2 pages into its range and sees idle peers (a shared counter)
bisects its own **remaining** range ``(last_key_seen, end)`` at a
lexicographically interpolated midpoint and enqueues the upper half. Ramp-up
from a single ``["", ∞)`` seed doubles the busy-worker count roughly every
page — ~log2(W) pages to saturate — and hot keyspace regions keep splitting
for as long as anyone is idle, with no prior run, no weights, and no reliance
on directory structure.

No gaps, no dups: a donation happens only after a page ending at
``last_key_seen`` was emitted, and ``last < mid < end`` is guaranteed by
:func:`key_midpoint` — the donor keeps ``(last, mid)`` (it continues its
pagination chain and stops at the shrunken end), the recipient starts at
``mid`` (inclusive: GCS ``start_offset`` natively; S3 via a HEAD-compensation
for the exclusive ``StartAfter``).

Output is the same shard-parquet + ``_SUCCESS.json`` contract as the planned
path, with one addition: the marker records every finished range's
``[start, end, rows]`` — the warm start for the next run (``--warm-from``),
which seeds the queue with converged boundaries instead of re-discovering
them. Shards interleave ranges, so they are *piecewise* sorted — exactly the
shape ``import -e stream``'s run-splitting merge consumes.

Interpolated midpoints operate on Unicode code points (skipping surrogates):
Python ``str`` comparison is code-point order, which equals UTF-8 byte order
— the order GCS and S3 list keys in — so ``a < m < b`` locally is
``a < m < b`` server-side too.

    nothing about what was actually emitted. A 2026-08-18 run at 16 procs wrote
    9,372,828 duplicate rows (34% of the listing) while reporting a correct
    object count — ``objects`` counts distinct keys — and exited 0. Nothing
    downstream noticed until the layer-2 rollup produced 1,156 TiB against a
    910 TiB quota.

    Deliberately does *not* delete the shards: the duplicates are the only
    evidence of the race that produced them, and a listing this expensive is
    not worth re-running blind. The missing ``_SUCCESS.json`` is what keeps a
    corrupt listing from being consumed (`import -l` globs shards, but every
    caller that resumes or warm-starts checks the marker).
