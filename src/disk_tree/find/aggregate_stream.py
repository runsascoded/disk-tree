"""O(depth) streaming aggregation over sorted listings (spec: streaming-aggregation.md).

Third engine alongside pandas (:func:`disk_tree.find.index.aggregate`) and
DuckDB (:mod:`disk_tree.find.aggregate_duckdb`). Object-store listings are
lexicographically sorted by key, and sorted-by-path is DFS order: every dir's
subtree is a contiguous key interval. So aggregation is the classic ``du``
algorithm — a stack of open ancestor dirs with running accumulators, popped
(and emitted) as soon as the stream leaves their subtree. Working state is
O(max depth); the DuckDB cascade's level re-materialization, long-VARCHAR hash
group-bys, and RSS overshoot all disappear.

Output contract is byte-identical to the other engines: canonical layer-2
rows sorted by ``(depth, path)`` with dir-before-file on equal path. The
stream pass writes per-``(depth, kind)`` parts (already ~sorted — see
:class:`_PartWriters`); the finalize is a depth-ascending ordered merge of
those parts (spec: depth-partitioned-finalize.md) — no external sort.

Parallelism (spec: stream-partition-parallel.md): ``jobs > 1`` partitions the
sorted keyspace into contiguous ranges streamed by worker processes; the few
dirs whose subtree interval spans a partition boundary are exported as partial
accumulator segments and monoid-merged in the parent (:func:`_reduce_partials`).
Output is byte-identical for any ``jobs``.

The one wrinkle: `//` canonicalization (``a//b`` → ``a/b``, same policy as
the other engines) does not preserve lexicographic order — raw ``a//z``
sorts before ``a/b`` but canonical ``a/z`` sorts after, and a dirty key's
canonical position can fall either before or after its raw position. A
single-pass stack over raw order would pop dirs prematurely. Fix: a cheap
names-only pre-scan finds the shards containing dirty keys (rare — a handful
out of 92.7M in marin's production listings); those rows are collected,
canonicalized, sorted, and joined into the k-way merge as one more sorted
source, so the stack only ever sees globally canonical-sorted rows.

    Same signature-shape and stats dict as
    :func:`disk_tree.find.aggregate_duckdb.aggregate_listing_to_parquet`.
    `listings` are parquet globs in earlier-source-wins order (the first glob
    containing any rows for `bucket` is used). Requires the raw listing
    schema (``bucket, name, size_bytes[, created]``) with shards *piecewise*
    sorted by key (bulk-list bin-packs sorted ranges into shards; each run
    becomes a merge source) — for anything else, `-e duckdb`.
    `pivot_sums` / `mean_mtime` are the opt-in aggregation extensions — all
    monoid sums, so they stream identically (see :mod:`disk_tree.find.agg_ext`).

    `jobs` partitions the keyspace into that many contiguous ranges streamed
    by parallel worker processes (pass-1 shard scans and the depth finalize
    parallelize through the same pool); 0 = all cores; the default 1 stays
    fully in-process. Output is byte-identical for any value (spec:
    stream-partition-parallel.md).

    **`jobs > 1` requires an import-safe caller.** The pool uses the `spawn`
    start method, so each worker re-imports the caller's `__main__`: a driver
    script that calls this at module top level re-executes itself in every
    worker and dies. Guard the call with `if __name__ == '__main__':` (or call
    from an importable module). Heredoc / `python -c` / stdin scripts cannot
    satisfy this — use `jobs=1` there.

    `con` / `memory_limit` / `temp_dir` / `max_temp_size` are accepted for
    call-site compatibility but unused: the finalize is a depth-partitioned
    ordered merge (see :func:`_finalize_parts`), not a DuckDB external sort,
    so there is nothing to cap or spill.
