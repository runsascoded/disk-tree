"""Layer-2b: read-size distribution per shallow prefix per time bin.

A *shallow* rollup, deliberately separate from the layer-2a tree
(:mod:`disk_tree.access.aggregate`) rather than extra columns on it:

- 2a is blob-grain across every depth; multiplying it by a size-bucket
  dimension would be enormous. This rollup stops at ``max_depth`` prefixes,
  where the distribution is the interesting object anyway.
- Being shallow, it can afford a finer *time* grain than 2a's day, and
  sparsity makes finer grains far cheaper than their nominal ratio
  (see :data:`DEFAULT_GRAIN`).

Why a histogram and not mean/variance: observed read sizes are sharply
multimodal — one 18h eu-west4 shard had 532,377 reads at exactly 8388608 bytes
(8 MiB) sitting alongside modes at 8196, 1087, 415 and 102 bytes. A mean of
2.81 MB describes none of that, and a stddev would only say "the modes are far
apart", not where they are.

Bucket key is ``round(log2(bytes) * LG2_SCALE)`` — 1/50 of an octave, ~1.4%
wide. Fine enough that adjacent constants separate (at 1/10 octave, the 1087-
and 1117-byte modes collide in one bucket), and nearly free because a mode
that is a single exact value occupies exactly one bucket at any resolution:
going from 1/10 to 1/50 octave cost 37% more rows on real data. Rounding
rather than flooring puts an exact power of two dead centre in its bucket
instead of on a boundary.

Zero-byte responses (HEADs, 304s, errors) have no logarithm and key to
:data:`ZERO_BYTES_BUCKET` instead of being dropped — they are a real and
distinct access mode.
