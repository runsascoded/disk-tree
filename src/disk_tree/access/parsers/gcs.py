"""GCS usage-log parser (layer-1a raw → canonical).

Google delivers hourly CSVs to a bucket you designate. Filename convention:
``<prefix>_usage_YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_SS_<id>_v0`` (usage) or ``_storage_`` (daily
byte-hours). This module handles the former; the latter is a bonus stats
table (bucket-level, no path attribution) parsed by
:func:`parse_storage_daily`.

Header row is present. Fields we care about (per
`Google's docs
<https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-logs#format>`_):

- ``time_micros`` — request time (usec since epoch)
- ``c_ip`` — client IP (best requester ID we get without extra work)
- ``cs_method`` — HTTP method (GET/PUT/DELETE/HEAD)
- ``cs_uri`` — request URI (includes query string)
- ``sc_status`` — response status
- ``cs_bytes`` / ``sc_bytes`` — request/response body sizes
- ``cs_user_agent``
- ``cs_operation`` — Google's own verb (``GET_Object``, ``LIST_Bucket``, …)
- ``cs_bucket`` / ``cs_object`` — bucket + key targeted
- ``s_request_id`` — Google's request id (used for dedupe: Google documents
  rare duplicate log lines; deduping on this field is idempotent).

The parser returns a DuckDB relation exposing the canonical
:data:`~disk_tree.access.schema.ACCESS_COLUMNS`. Callers can materialize
to parquet with ``rel.write_parquet(path)`` or feed it directly to
:mod:`disk_tree.access.aggregate`.

    # the candidates, not key on. The docs never call s_request_id unique, and
    # it is not: one id can cover many distinct objects. In a sampled file the
    # largest such group is 9 records, all zero-byte PUT_Object, user-agent
    # "GCS Lifecycle Management" — i.e. an internal lifecycle *batch operation*
    # (storage-class transitions surface as PUTs), not an HTTP request, logged
    # under one id with one microsecond timestamp across scattered sibling
    # prefixes. Keying on the id discarded all but one per group: measured at
    # 2,408 lost PUTs over 7h on marin-us-east1, the fleet's *smallest* bucket,
    # understating its PUTs by 53%. (Those PUTs are largely lifecycle churn,
    # not application writes, so recovering them matters for correctness, not
    # as a write-recency signal — treat with care.)
    #
    # Measured structure: within a multi-record id, cs_object is the ONLY field
    # that varies (90/90 groups sampled) — time_micros, c_ip, cs_method,
    # cs_operation, sc_status, cs_user_agent constant; cs_uri / cs_bytes /
    # sc_bytes / time_taken_micros all NULL. So the records are distinguishable
    # purely by object name, and two actions on the *same* object under one id
    # would be byte-identical and collapse. The schema carries no sequence
    # field, so that case is unresolvable in principle, not just here; zero such
    # (id, object) collisions in the sampled file.
    #
    # Full-record equality is exactly the documented notion of a duplicate, so
    # it needs no heuristic about which fields distinguish a batch member.
    # Cost is a wash: DISTINCT ON already had to carry all twelve output
    # columns through its hash aggregate, so keying on all of them instead of
    # three changes the group *count*, not the row width — and with near-zero
    # real duplicates the group count is ~n either way. What must be avoided is
    # row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY ...), which materializes every raw column
    # (incl. fat unused strings like cs_uri / cs_referer) and is DuckDB's
    # worst-spilling operator; it OOM'd on a real 40M-request hour.
    #
    # Two records identical across all twelve canonical fields are collapsed
    # even if some *raw* field we discard (e.g. time_taken_micros) differed.
    # That is deliberate: such records are indistinguishable in our schema, so
