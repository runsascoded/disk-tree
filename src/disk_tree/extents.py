"""Physical-extent mapping: which of a subtree's bytes are actually its own.

`gfind -printf '%b'` charges a file's allocated blocks to every path that links
them, so a subtree's *reported* size is an upper bound on what deleting it
frees. Hardlinks are at least visible to `stat` (`nlink > 1`); APFS **clones**
(reflinks) are not — distinct inodes, `nlink == 1`, full block count each — and
on this platform they are the dominant sharing mechanism: `uv` and `pnpm` both
populate project trees by cloning from their caches.

The only way to tell owned bytes from shared ones is to ask the filesystem
where a file physically lives. `fcntl(F_LOG2PHYS_EXT)` answers that per logical
range; two paths that map to the same device offsets share the same blocks.

Note the struct is *packed* — `u_int32_t` immediately followed by two `off_t`,
no alignment padding — which is why the format below is `=Iqq` (20 bytes) and
not the 24 bytes natural alignment would suggest.
