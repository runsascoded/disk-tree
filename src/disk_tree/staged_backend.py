"""Wiring between the pure staged-delete engine (`disk_tree.staged`) and the
real backends/DB (spec ``specs/staged-delete.md``).

The engine takes ``size_fn``/``delete_fn`` injected so it stays backend- and
DB-free; this is the one place that binds them to the actual scan DB and
``backend_for``. Shared by the CLI (``cli/staged.py``) and the Flask server.

The session comes from a standalone SQLAlchemy engine over
``config.SQLITE_PATH`` — *not* flask-sqlalchemy's ``init()``, which pushes its
own app context and so corrupts the server's request context when called inside
a request handler.
