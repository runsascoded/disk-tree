"""Native macOS window around the disk-tree Flask server (pywebview).

Runs the existing Flask app (`disk_tree.server.app`) on a loopback port in a
daemon thread, then opens a WKWebView window pointed at it. Bundled as
`disk-tree.app` (see `packaging/macos/`), this gives scans a stable TCC
identity — prompts and Full Disk Access show "disk-tree", not "python3.13" —
and one FDA grant covers the app's child `gfind` reads. See
`specs/macos-app.md`.

Run directly for development: `disk-tree-app` (needs the `app` extra:
`uv sync --extra app`). The window and the CLI/server share the same config
and DB, so a scan started here shows up everywhere.
