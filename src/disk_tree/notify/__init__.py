"""disk-tree notify/digest engine (``specs/comms-notify.md``).

A generic Slack + Discord digest mechanism — converge state, one thread per
period, an OP edited in place, day-keyed replies, hosted plot — driven by a
per-deployment ``DigestProfile`` (body builder, plot panels, metric semantics).
Generalized from ``marin-gcs-usage``'s ``dt_cloud`` comms.

``discord_api`` is stdlib-only; the posting engine needs the ``notify`` extra
(``thrds``).
