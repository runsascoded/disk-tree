"""Listing-source normalization: raw object-listing parquet + SII / S3-Inventory reports.

:func:`prepare_listing` returns a parenthesized SQL fragment exposing the
canonical layer-1 columns (``bucket, name, size_bytes, created,
storage_class_id``) over one or more parquet globs, usable anywhere the
pipeline previously interpolated ``read_parquet('<glob>')``. Sources may mix
schemas:

- raw object-listing parquet (e.g. `bucket_list.py` output, or marin's
  ``scan_gcs`` listings) passes through unchanged;
- GCS Storage Insights inventory reports are renamed/cast (``size`` →
  ``size_bytes``, ``timeCreated`` → ``created``, ``storageClass`` string →
  class id) with soft-deleted rows (``timeDeleted``) dropped.

When several sources cover the same bucket, the earliest listed source wins —
so ``-l <fresh SII glob> -l <older full scan>`` reads fresh buckets from the
former and only the missing buckets (e.g. ``marin-us-central2``, where SII is
unavailable) from the latter.
