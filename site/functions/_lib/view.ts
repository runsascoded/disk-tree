/** One view = "path + scan + scope + pixel budget", answered from the index
 * tiers (specs/view-serving.md §1–2). Shared by `/api/subtree` (the map),
 * `/api/todo` (the review backlog) and anything else that wants a folded tree.
 *
 * Treemap area is proportional to bytes, so "everything this canvas can draw
 * under P" is one predicate: b ≥ P.b · minArea / (w·h), attenuated per level.
 * Every tier holds rows `(path, depth, usr, b, o, …)`, descendant-
 * inclusive, sorted `(depth, path)` (or by usr for a user lens), so a query
 * is row-group-pruned range reads, a threshold filter, and a nested-tree
 * assembly with `(other)` = parent − Σ kept children (exact by subtraction).
 *
 * Tier planning: the coarse tiers keep only paths whose subtree clears an
 * absolute floor F_E (the job writes E = 16, 20, 24). Descendant-inclusive
 * bytes are monotone, so when the query's threshold is ≥ F_E the tier's rows
 * are a superset of what the query keeps and the answer is identical to the
 * floor-free tier's — just read from a few row groups instead of the whole
 * file. The planner picks the coarsest such tier; a path below every floor
 * (or a scan without coarse tiers) reads the floor-free tier.
