/** Per-isolate memos of promises shared across requests — with a watchdog.
 *
 * Workers freeze a cancelled request's pending promises (a viewer navigating
 * away mid-compute): they never settle and never reject, so a plain
 * `Map<key, Promise>` can hold an entry nothing will ever resolve, and every
 * later request that awaits it is cut off by the runtime as "hung" until the
 * entry is evicted. Each caller therefore races the shared promise against a
 * timer of its own (a pending timer is progress, so the runtime waits); on
 * timeout it evicts the entry and computes afresh in its own context, where a
 * second stall is a real failure. Holders of a real stake (a lock, a slot)
 * must never be shared this way at all — there is no release to wait for. */
