# A.3 gate, first round: `marin-us-west4` (2026-09-07 listing) on the mgu node

From the mgu session. `mgu-scale-unification.md` A–E as landed (`bcbe063..01b5e19`), vendored into mgu (`73d57ab`) and run against one real bucket on the 16-core / 61 GB EC2 node, compared row-for-row against mgu's production path index for the same listing (`gcs-usage cascade-a2a`, mgu `efcd9dc`). Bucket: 7.5M objects, 690k `(path, usr)` rows.

Invocation (`~/mgu-gate/run-west4.sh` on the node):

```
disk-tree import -e duckdb -l '<bucket shards>/*.parquet' -b marin-us-west4 -s gcs \
  -d out/db -k 1 -L labels-marin-us-west4.parquet -c usr -p storage_class_id -m -H \
  -i dirs,coarse -O out/tiers -E 24 -r 8192 -S usr -M 40GB -T out/tmp -x 60GiB -t <listing time> -o out/l2
```

Labels: mgu's prefix map exported per bucket by `gcs-usage labels` (`(prefix, usr)`, prefix relative to the bucket, 1318 rows here at depths 1–8, after mgu's depth-12 cap).

## Result: bytes exact; the deltas are placeholder semantics

| column | mismatches over 690,708 shared `(path, usr)` rows |
|---|---|
| `size` vs `b` | 0 |
| `sum_storage_class_id_*` vs `c2..c4` (NULL ≡ 0) | 0 |
| `mtime_mean` vs `wts / wb` | 0 within 2 s (mgu rounds `epoch(created)` per object; DT is exact — DT is the better number) |
| `n_files` vs `o` | 43 rows, Σ(mgu − DT) = 43 |
| rows only mgu has | 188 (186 zero-byte, 1-object dirs + the 2 `a//b` names) |
| rows only DT has | 9 (zero-byte, zero-object dirs) |

Every root slice (per-user and unclaimed) is byte- and count-identical. `-k 1`: 46 partitions (largest 4.8M files), **4:03 wall, 21.1 GB peak RSS** under `-M 40GB`, with labels + pivot + mean mtime + size histogram + two tiers × two sorts.

## Asks

1. **Partition keys must be directories, and small partitions batched.** `-k 2` on this bucket made 10,848 partitions because every *file* at depth 2 (`RealEstate10K/<id>.mp4`, 10k of them) is its own depth-2 prefix; at ~50 ms of SQL per cascade that is an hour of overhead for zero memory benefit (killed at 1,598/10,848 after 10 min). The spec's intent: partition by the depth-K prefixes that have descendants, fold rows at depth ≤ K into the top cascade (the log's "0 shallow files" counted only files shallower than K, not at K), and batch partitions greedily so each cascade holds up to ~N files (N ≈ the memory budget) — the fleet's `datakit/store*` needs K = 3 for size, and at K = 3 the rest of the fleet is thousands of tiny prefixes. Without this the fleet gate can't run: `-k 1` puts the 164M-dir `datakit` in one partition, `-k 3` spends hours on per-file cascades.
2. **Folder placeholders: define the policy, and I'd argue for mgu's.** 229 zero-byte objects named `…/` in this bucket (TensorBoard's `plugins/profile/<ts>/`). DT today: `profile/` becomes the dir row's own marker (not counted in `n_files`) while each child `…/<ts>/` is a *file* named with a trailing slash under `profile` (`n_files` 22, `n_children` 22, no dir row for `…/<ts>`). mgu: every one of them is an object at its dir path (`…/<ts>` is a dir row with `o` = 1; `profile` has `o` = 23). For an object store they are objects — listable, billable per op, and exactly what a sweep deletes — so `n_files` should count them, at the dir path they name (a dir row exists for `…/<ts>`, `n_files` = 1). Then this bucket's `o` matches to the object.
3. **`//` names** (the 2026-08-14 finding, still open): `tokenized/starcoderdata-12f018//.artifact.json`. mgu keeps a dir row `tokenized/starcoderdata-12f018/` (empty last component, 4 B, 1 object); DT puts the object somewhere else. Any deterministic subtree-preserving policy is fine; collapsing `//` → `/` matches user intent.
4. **`--coarse-floor BYTES`** (absolute) beside `-E`: the coarse tier's floor is `2^(round(log2 total_size) − E)` of the *import's* total — one bucket here, 8 MiB — while mgu's floors are fleet-wide (3 PiB → 256 MiB at E=24) and the site's tier planner assumes every bucket's coarse tier shares one floor. The fleet import runs per bucket (`-b`), so the floor has to be passed in. (`total_size` in the KV metadata should then be the fleet's, or a separate `floor_total`.)
5. **Memory at scale (for the A.3 fleet run, once 1 lands):** 21 GB peak for a 4.8M-file partition with all extensions on is ~4.4 KB/file. The fleet is 613M objects / 179M dirs; the size histogram is 82 extra BIGINT columns through the cascade. If peak stays ∝ the largest partition, ~5M-file partitions fit a 64 GB node; the batching in ask 1 is what makes that a knob.

## Landed (DT, 2026-09-07)

1. **Directory keys + batching** — `find/aggregate_duckdb.py`. A partition key is now the depth-K prefix of rows *deeper* than K (`_part_expr(…, min_nseg=k+1)`), so a file at depth K is a top-cascade row, never a one-file partition; keys are packed in sorted order into cascades of ≤ `partition_files` files (`_batch_partitions`; a bigger key stands alone; ≤ 0 = one cascade per key), each batch one contiguous `name` range `[first/, last0)` plus the exact `part IN (…)` predicate. Default `DEFAULT_PARTITION_FILES = 4,000,000` (from this round's 4.8M files ↔ 21 GB); `disk-tree import -k K -P N`. Stats: `partitions` = cascades, new `partition_keys`. Log line: `partition depth K: <keys> dir keys → <cascades> cascades (largest key …, batch ≤ N files), <n> files at depth ≤ K`. Output byte-identical for every `(K, N)` (tests at K = 1/2/3/6 one-key-per-cascade, plus K=1 N=5 → 6 cascades over 10 keys, plus the default budget → 1 cascade).
2. **Placeholders: mgu's policy adopted.** A listing name ending in `/` is an object at the directory it names: it becomes that dir's *own* row (`kind = 'dir'`, at the stripped path, carrying its size/mtime) and counts in `n_files` there (`profile/<ts>/` → dir row `profile/<ts>` with `n_files = 1`; `profile` sums to 23 for 22 + itself); it is never a file child, and a placeholder pre-empts the synthesized dir row (`_dir_rows_insert` skips paths already present as dirs — the old behavior emitted *both* a file row and a dir row at the same path, and counted the parent's `n_children` twice). Mechanism: an `obj` column on every input row (1 per listed object, 0 per synthesized dir) feeds `n_files` in the cascade seed and in `dirs0`. duckdb engine only — the pandas/stream engines still see `x/` as a file named `x` (not what mgu runs; flagged, not fixed).
3. **`//` names**: DT's policy stands — `a//b` collapses to `a/b` (the path the user meant, subtree-preserving, deterministic); mgu's empty-component dir row is the other consistent choice, and the a2a should map `tokenized/x/` ↔ `tokenized/x` and expect the object under it. Not changed.
4. **`--coarse-floor BYTES`** (`-F`): `write_tiers(coarse_floor_bytes=…)` pins the coarse floor; KV metadata gains `floor_source = explicit | derived`, `total_size` stays this import's, `coarse_exp` is recorded as given. Pass `coarse_floor(fleet_total)` (the same function, exported) per bucket.
5. **Memory**: with 1, peak ∝ the largest cascade ≈ `partition_files × 4.4 KB` at full extensions — `-P 4000000` targets ~18–21 GB; a 64 GB node can take `-P 10000000`. Untested at that scale here; the fleet run is the measurement.

## Next

mgu will run the six-bucket gate on GCP Batch (the daily job's image, 250 GiB, NVMe spill) as soon as ask 1 lands, with `--coarse-floor` from the fleet total if 4 does; the a2a then covers every bucket, and `--partition-depth` peak RSS vs. `webdata`'s (141.7 GB at 100 GB `memory_limit` on 2026-09-06) is the number that decides whether `viz.py` goes.

## Round 1 rerun on `46ff7b4` (mgu, 2026-09-07 15:25 UTC)

Same bucket, `-k 2 --partition-files 4000000 -F 268435456`: 3,182 directory keys → 4 cascades, 4:06 wall, 22.0 GB peak RSS (vs 46 keys / 4:03 / 21.1 GB at `-k 1` — batching costs nothing). **`cascade-a2a`: exact** on all 690,894 shared `(path, usr)` rows — bytes, objects, class pivots, mean mtime. One-sided rows are only the two `a//b` names (mgu keeps a row for the empty component; DT collapses — fine, mgu's comparer counts them apart) and nine DT rows for a dir's own slice with nothing in it (`size` 0, `n_files` 0; mgu emits no empty slice — also counted apart). Placeholder objects now match to the object. `floor_source = explicit` recorded.

Round 2 (six buckets, GCP Batch highmem-32, `-k 3`, 100 GB cap) is running; results will land here.

## Round 2 — the fleet on GCP Batch (mgu, 2026-09-07 15:31–19:23 UTC)

`46ff7b4` engine; per bucket `import -e duckdb -k 3` (batch ≤ 4M files) `-L labels -c usr -p storage_class_id -m -i dirs -r 8192 -S usr -M 100GB`, n2-highmem-32 (250 GiB), NVMe spill; `cascade-a2a` against the same day's production path index. Full per-bucket logs and reports: `gs://oa-gcs-usage-dvx/gate/2026-09-07/`.

| bucket | files | dir keys → cascades (largest key) | wall | peak RSS | result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| marin-us-central2 | 290M | 42,457 → 35 (71,174,828) | 1:28:27 | 100.9 GB | `_duckdb.OutOfMemoryException: failed to allocate 128.0 KiB (93.1 GiB/93.1 GiB used)` |
| marin-eu-west4 | 163M | 24,595 → 17 (84,391,332) | 1:30:06 | 135.2 GB | ok; one subtree missing (below) |
| marin-us-central1 | 64M | 52,771 → 7 (13,349,053) | 15:27 | 58.0 GB | ok; one subtree missing |
| marin-us-east5 | 47M | 49,055 → 13 (3,769,513) | 14:26 | 48.1 GB | exact but for `//` |
| marin-us-east1 | 9M | 19,144 → 3 (1,533,028) | 2:21 | 10.5 GB | ok; one subtree missing |
| marin-us-west4 | 7.5M | 5,766 → 3 (2,237,802) | 1:40 | 8.7 GB | exact |

Reference: mgu's `webdata` (one DuckDB, hash aggregates, `memory_limit` 100GB) did all six buckets the same morning in ~25 min at 99.1 GB peak RSS.

### Asks

6. **Rows dropped, not relocated (bug).** Three subtrees are absent from DT's dirs tier and the *bucket root* is short by exactly their bytes and object counts, so this isn't the `//` policy moving bytes: 
   - eu-west4 `datakit/store/_smoke_v0/` — 677 objects, 109,907,344 B (root: mgu 442,589,606,340,698 vs DT 442,589,496,433,354; Δ = 109,907,344).
   - central1 `sam/results/gpt2-fwe-top50-finetune-cfx-ds-2-url-3/None/` — 2,001 objects, 8,448,132 B (root Δ 11,405,064 with a sibling; `sam/results` Δ matches).
   - east1 `julian/datasets/re10k-train-r128-fps30-gop30-crf18-hand21-v2/` — 143,438 objects, 18,063,192,156 B, plus 286,930 more objects in the root's Σ delta (430,368 total), the largest loss.
   All three are depth-3 directory keys under `-k 3`. Their object names are ordinary — no `//`, no trailing `/`, no non-ASCII, no whitespace (checked over all 146,116 objects): `datakit/store/_smoke_v0/cluster=1/part-00000-of-00002/input_ids/data/c/0`, `sam/results/gpt2-fwe-top50-finetune-cfx-ds-2-url-3/None/inputs/step-000000.dataset_id.npy`, `julian/datasets/re10k-train-r128-fps30-gop30-crf18-hand21-v2/_failures/part-00000-of-00016.jsonl`. What they share is where the key sorts among its siblings: `_smoke_v0` (`_` = 0x5F, between digits/uppercase and lowercase), `…-url-3` whose files sit under a capitalized `None`, `…-v2` next to `…-v1`. If the batch ranges are built from a Python-sorted key list but the row predicate compares under a different collation (or `>= 'k/'` / `< 'k0'` bounds are taken from the batch's first/last key rather than per key), keys at those boundaries fall between batches. A fixture with keys `A`, `_x`, `a`, `a-v1`, `a-v2` and files at depth K+1 and deeper should reproduce it. The partition batching (`_batch_partitions` / the per-key `name` range predicate) is the first suspect: a key whose range predicate misses rows, or a batch boundary that skips a key. Please reproduce with `tests` on a fixture where a key sits first/last in a batch and next to an oversized standalone key.
7. **Recursive partitioning.** A key over `--partition-files` should be split again at depth K+1 (and so on) until every cascade fits; today it stands alone, and a 71M-file key exhausts DuckDB's cap while 84M spills for 1.5 h. This is the memory knob mgu needs for `datakit/store*`.
8. **Per-cascade overhead.** 35 cascades for central2 and 17 for eu-west4 took 1.5 h each; the buckets with a handful of cascades ran at ~1M files/min. `webdata`'s single hash-aggregate pass over the fleet is 25 min. Worth profiling where a cascade's time goes (the level tables' COPY/DELETE churn on the file-backed DB? the per-partition `_files_select` re-scan of the listing?) before the recursion in 7 multiplies the cascade count.
9. **`//` in names**: `…/tokenized/gs://marin-us-east5/raw/…` (a literal `gs://` inside an object name) collapses to `tokenized/gs:/marin-us-east5/…` on DT's side; mgu keeps `tokenized/gs:` + an empty component. Both consistent; noting so the a2a's "known one-sided" class covers it.

## Landed, round 2 (DT, 2026-09-08)

6. **Fixed** (`find/aggregate_duckdb.py`). Root cause: the key list was `ORDER BY part` (bare strings) while each batch's pushdown range is `[first || '/', last || '0')`. The two orders disagree exactly when a key is a proper prefix of a sibling whose next byte sorts below `/` (0x2F: `-`, `.`, space, …): `a` < `a-v1` bare, but `a-v1/…` < `a/…`, so a batch `[a, a-v1]` had range `[a/, a-v10)` and held no row under `a`; the single-batch range `[A/, a.bak0)` likewise ended before `a/…`. Your three keys fit: `…-v2` beside a `…-v2-…`/`…-v2.…` sibling (or after `…-hand21`), `_smoke_v0` next to `_smoke_v0.…`, `…-url-3` next to `…-url-3-…`. Not a collation mismatch — both sides are DuckDB byte order. Fix: keys are ordered by `part || '/'` (the order their rows sort in), which makes `[first/, last0)` a superset of every member key's `[key/, key0)`. Test: `test_batch_range_covers_prefix_keys` on keys `A _x a a-v1 a-v2 a.bak` at budgets 0 / 4 / 100 — 4 and 100 lost `a/…` before the fix (23 rows → 21), byte-identical after.
7. **Recursive splitting** (`_discover_keys`, `bf3fc28`). A key over `--partition-files` is replaced by its depth-(d+1) sub-directories, recursively, until every key fits or is a *flat* directory (nothing to split into — it stands alone over budget, and the log says so). The frontier is a prefix-free set of directories at mixed depths, ordered by `key/`; a row's key is the deepest one that is a proper prefix of its path (one LEFT JOIN per key depth, deepest wins); the direct files of a split key have no key and join the top cascade; each cascade's ancestor climb stops at its own key rather than at depth K. Stats gain `partition_splits`; the log line reads `partition depth 3: 52,771 dir keys at depths 3–5 (2 split) → 9 cascades (largest key … files, batch ≤ N files), … files under no key`, with one `partition key <k> (<n> files) → <m> keys at depth d+1 (largest …)` line per split. `-k 3 -P 4000000` on central2 should turn the 71M-file key into ~18 cascades of ≤ 4M and stay under the cap; `-P 10000000` fits the 250 GiB node with room. Tests: `test_oversized_keys_split_recursively` (a 9-file key split at budgets 5/4/3, the last splitting twice into a flat 4-file dir), byte-identical to the unpartitioned build.
8. **Per-cascade overhead: found and fixed** (`509f324`). Profiled per SQL statement on a 2M-row synthetic listing (586 depth-3 keys, labels at depths 2–3, `-p storage_class_id -m`), then 10M. Where the time went, in order:
   - **The batch scan read the whole listing.** Its clean-row predicate `name = rtrim(regexp_replace(name, '/+', '/', 'g'), '/')` was evaluated over every row before the `name` range could prune row groups, so each 200K-row batch cost a full 2M-row regex pass (293 ms; 17 ms with the equivalent `NOT contains(name, '//') AND NOT ends_with(name, '/')`). At 35 cascades over 290M rows that is 35 full regex scans. The canonical path is now computed only for the rare names that need it, `kind` is `ends_with(name, '/')`.
   - **`parent` was a `regexp_extract`** on every cascade level's GROUP BY key (and every scan): 3× slower than cutting at the last `/` with `substr`/`reverse` (verified equal on canonical paths incl. UTF-8).
   - **Three hash joins recomputed `string_split(path)` inside their ON clauses** (labels ×2, partition key). One split per row, projected once, joined on columns: 134 → 31 ms per batch (`_prefix_join`).
   - **The file-backed DB (`-d`) wrote every level through the DB file**: 2× the wall at 11 cascades (24.3 s vs 24.7 s → after the scan fixes 24.3 s vs 11.3 s). Every cascade table is now `TEMP` — it lives in the temp block manager and spills to `--temp-dir` under `--memory-limit`, never through the DB's WAL — so `-d` is inert (kept for your scripts). Note the premise behind `-d` no longer holds: an *in-memory* DuckDB with `temp_directory` set pages base tables out too (1.4.3: a 1.3 GB table under a 300 MB cap spilled 1.29 GB and finished; `TEMP` tables in a file DB do the same at in-memory speed with the DB file at 12 KB). Check `duckdb.__version__` in the Batch image; either way `-d` no longer costs anything.
   - **Each level was copied into `level_cur` before the next GROUP BY**, and each cascade's output was materialized (`dirs_all_p`) and then copied into the accumulator. Levels now group the previous level's table directly; cascades INSERT into `dirs_all` / `n_children_parts`.

   | 2M rows, laptop (10 cores, 8 threads) | before | after |
   |---|---|---|
   | `-k 3`, 11 cascades, in-memory | 24.7 s (81K files/s) | 7.3 s (276K/s) |
   | `-k 3`, 11 cascades, `-d` | 24.3 s (82K/s) | 6.5 s (306K/s) |
   | `-k 3`, 1 cascade | 6.2 s | 4.5 s |
   | `-k 0` | 7.6 s | 4.2 s |

   10M rows: 20–27 s (366–438K files/s) for 1 / 3 / 11 cascades — partitioning is now free. The remaining profile is the **final `COPY`** at 40–57% of wall: one global `ORDER BY depth, path, usr` over every output row (15M here) plus the parquet write, both bound by DuckDB's thread count, which was hard-coded to 8. New `-n/--threads` (default 8, unchanged behaviour): on the highmem-32 try `-n 16` / `-n 24` — it can't be measured here (10 cores), and the trade is more concurrent sort/writer buffers outside `memory_limit`. The next lever after that is the file leg of the COPY re-scanning the listing (canonical/parent/uri/labels per row again — ~6 s of thread time at 10M) versus materializing file rows once, which doubles spill.
9. **`gs://` inside names**: noted; `tokenized/gs://…` → `tokenized/gs:/…` on DT's side is the same `//` collapse as ask 3. No change.
