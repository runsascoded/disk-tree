# disk-tree

Disk/cloud space usage analyzer: a scanning/indexing CLI (`disk-tree`), a cloud overlay (`dt-cloud`), and a Cloudflare-hosted site (`site/`) over the indexes.

## Project Vision

Track disk space usage across:
- Local filesystems (laptop, external SSDs)
- S3 buckets

Key goals:
- **Always-ready index**: Run overnight scans so you don't wait when running out of space
- **External media snapshots**: Keep cached views of SSDs even when unplugged
- **Fast indexing**: Shell out to `gfind`/`aws s3 ls` instead of slow Python stat calls
- **Site**: Treemap visualizations, diffs and an age lens over each scan's path index

## Architecture

### Python Backend (`src/disk_tree/`)

**Indexing** (`find/index.py`):
- Local: `gfind -printf '%y %b %T@ %p\0'` → null-terminated, 512-byte block sizes (handles sparse files)
- S3: `aws s3 ls --recursive` → parses listing format
- Excludes CloudStorage paths (`~/Library/CloudStorage`) to avoid blocking on cloud I/O
- Builds DataFrame with columns: `path`, `size`, `mtime`, `kind`, `parent`, `uri`, `n_desc`, `n_children`, `depth`
- `depth` column enables predicate pushdown when loading parquet (major performance win)
- Aggregates sizes upward through directory tree
- Returns `IndexResult(df, error_count, error_paths)`

**Data Model** (`sqla/model.py`):
- `Scan` table: `id`, `path`, `time`, `blob`, `error_count`, `error_paths`, `size`, `n_children`, `n_desc`
  - Root stats (`size`, `n_children`, `n_desc`) denormalized to avoid parquet reads on scan list
- `ScanProgress` table: real-time tracking of active scans
- Results stored as Parquet in `~/.config/disk-tree/scans/<uuid>.parquet`
- SQLite metadata DB at `~/.config/disk-tree/disk-tree.db`
- Index on `(path, time)` for efficient latest-scan-per-path queries

**CLI** (`cli/`):
```bash
disk-tree index [URL]     # Scan a directory, an s3:// bucket, or an r2:// bucket (S3-compatible: lists
                          # through the bucket's endpoint — `DISK_TREE_R2_ENDPOINT_URL` or its
                          # buckets.yml `endpoint_url` — with `r2://` uris). gcs:// has no live lister
                          # and refuses (`UnsupportedBackend`): use `bulk-list` + `import` for it
  -C, --no-cache-read     # Force fresh scan (`index` otherwise returns any cached scan unconditionally)
  -e, --require-external  # Skip (exit 0) if the write target is the boot disk (no opted-in external
                          # volume mounted). For scheduled scans that must land on external media
  -g, --gc                # Garbage collect old scans
  -m, --mean-mtime        # Emit `mtime_mean` (size-weighted mean mtime; feeds the UI age lens)
  -M, --measure-memory    # Track peak memory
  -o, --one-fs            # Don't descend into filesystems mounted below URL. `index -o /` on macOS = the

                          # (default: warn and suggest `--to`)
  -s, --sudo              # Run gfind with sudo (implies `-C`: a cached scan can't be known to be sudo)
  -t, --to TARGET         # Write this scan's blob to a dir or fsspec URL (r2://bucket/prefix, s3://…,
                          # gs://…) instead of the configured write dir; it joins the search path for
                          # this run, so the scan reads back through it (spec `remote-scan-targets.md`)
  -x, --extents           # Map physical extents → per-dir reclaimable bytes (APFS clones/hardlinks),
                          # written as a `<blob>.reclaim.parquet` sidecar. macOS + local scans only;
                          # exact when the scan root contains the sharing sources (home/full scan),
                          # else an upper bound. `du` shows a `frees` column when the sidecar exists

disk-tree capture PATH -t URL  # The split pipeline for a ~full disk (spec `cloud-reduce.md`): gfind →
                          # layer-1 listing shards streamed straight to a dir/URL (`r2://…`), bounded
                          # memory, zero local disk. Files only (dirs implied; APFS dirs hold 0 blocks).
                          # Prints the capture dir `<to>/<host>/<root>/<stamp>` (+ `_SUCCESS.json`);

disk-tree scans register SRC  # Import `*.scan.json` manifests (one file, or a dir/URL of them) into
                          # this DB. `index --to <url>` writes one beside each remote blob (the Scan
                          # row, portable). Idempotent; put the blobs' dir on `DISK_TREE_SCAN_DIRS`
                          # so they resolve

disk-tree scans           # List cached scans (JSON)

                          # (`gs://`, `r2://`, `s3://`). Streams by row group (never a whole file in memory):
                          # drops `uri` (scan root → metadata; refused unless `uri == <root>/<path>` on every

                          # `$DISK_TREE_PARQUET_CODEC` in ≤64K-row groups to a `.v2.tmp` sibling, verifies
                          # (row count + order-insensitive digest of `(path,size,mtime,kind)`), then swaps
                          # (atomic rename; copy + delete on a URL). v2 input is skipped; a failure leaves
                          # the original untouched, exit 1. `-n` dry-run, `-k` keeps `<stem>.v1.parquet`,

disk-tree tiers L2        # Cut the path store's sorts (spec `path-store.md` §1.2/§4.1) from a layer-2 — a

                          # every row (objects + dirs) sorted `(depth, path, …labels)`; `bysize` = the same

                          # -a to include files, -j for JSON). Sizes are per-path block counts,
                          # so extents shared via APFS clones/hardlinks are charged to every

                          # Shows a `frees` column (true reclaim) when a `-x` reclaim sidecar exists

disk-tree reclaim PATH…   # What deleting PATHs would *actually* free: maps each file's physical
                          # extents (`fcntl(F_LOG2PHYS_EXT)`) and subtracts blocks the surviving
                          # partner roots still reference (`-p` adds one, `-P` drops the
                          # auto-detected uv/pnpm caches). macOS-only. Measured 2026-08-29:
                          # `oa/marin/.venv` reports 2.84 GiB, frees 249 MiB (91% cloned from

disk-tree repos ROOT      # Delete-safety audit of git repos under ROOT (cleanup companion to `du`):

disk-tree volumes [PATH]  # The APFS container PATH (default `/`) lives on: each volume's used bytes, mount
                          # point and snapshots, plus free space — what no walk shows (Preboot, VM/swap,
                          # Recovery, the sealed System volume, OS-update snapshots). `-j` JSON. macOS-only

disk-tree stage URI…      # Stage URIs for deletion into a shared open plan (spec staged-delete.md,
                          # CP1). The opt-in "delete" model: nothing dies by inaction
disk-tree staged          # List open plans (staged sets) + recent runs (-j for JSON)
disk-tree unstage URI…    # Remove URIs from every open plan
disk-tree undo RUN_ID     # Undo a deletion run: restore the objects it deleted where the store allows
                          # it (S3/R2 versioning — remove the delete-markers; local has no undo).
                          # Dry by default (report restorable scope); `-f`/`--for-real` restores. Records
                          # the run's `undo_state` (spec staged-delete.md CP5)

disk-tree dispatch [PLAN] # Execute a plan (id/name; default the open `Staged` plan): delete its
                          # staged URIs via the backend, or (default) dry-run + report bytes/objects.
                          # `-f`/`--for-real` deletes + closes the plan; records a run + per-URI bands.
                          # `-s`/`--serve` instead runs the CP4 drainer: poll the edge's D1 (the
                          # browser dispatched runs there; the edge can't reach user buckets) via the
                          # `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and execute each enqueued run here, deleting through
                          # `backend_for` (`-i` base poll secs, `-o` once, Ctrl-C stops). Announces
                          # per-run results to Slack/Discord per the `delete:` block in buckets.yml
                          # (`chat`/`undo`/`database_id` + secret ENV VAR NAMES); needs `notify` for chat
```

### Site (`site/`) and widget packages

`site/` is the hosted/serverless app: Vite + React + TypeScript, with Pages Functions over R2 / GCS +
D1 (disk.rbw.sh, r2.rbw.sh, the gcs/cw deployments). Its chart-lib-free DIY-SVG/canvas widgets come
from two workspace packages:
- **`@rdub/treemap`** (`packages/treemap/`) — the SOTA treemap core + layout/color primitives:
  `<Treemap>` (SVG + canvas renderers, shared-edge tiling, dust texturing, per-cell `ring`
  emphasis, hover/pin events), `<VoronoiTreemap>` (`/voronoi` subpath), `useHoverPin`, `squarify`,
  `DEFAULT_PALETTE`/`ageFade`/`parseQuery`, `styles.css`. Disk-agnostic; the intended external
  consumer (e.g. file-tree) pins this.
- **`@disk-tree/react`** (`packages/react/`) — `<TimeSeries>`/`<BytesOverTime>` built on the core
  (which it re-exports for back-compat).

### Cloud site auth routes (`site/functions/`)

One gate (`_lib/auth.ts`, `@open-athena/auth` over D1): `identify` → `Identity` (`via: session | grant | public`), `requireViewer` / `requireStager` / `requireAdmin`.
- `/auth/google` (+ `/callback`, `/onetap`) — Google OIDC → email session; `/auth/email/*` — emailed code / magic link → email session
- `/api/auth/*` — the package's routes: `whoami`, `exchange` (`?key=` share link → grant session), `logout`, request-access, admin grant/request/log console
- `/api/token` — a session's personal agent token (a non-expiring Bearer grant, the base scope only; grants can't mint one)
- `POST /api/app-link` → `GET /auth/app-link?token=` — the macOS app's sign-in hand-off ("Open in disky" in the user menu): a session mints a single-use, 60 s grant for its own email + scopes (same-origin POST only); the app's webview redeems it into an ordinary email session and the grant is revoked. Contract: `specs/app-link.md`

## Development

```bash
# Python setup — one uv workspace: the engine (root) + the cloud overlay
# (`cloud/`, package `dt-cloud`) share ONE `uv.lock` and one `.venv`.
uv sync                                                 # engine only
uv sync --all-packages --all-extras --all-groups        # engine + dt-cloud, every extra, test groups
disk-tree index .

# Site
pnpm install
cd site && pnpm dev
```

## Packaging / Distribution

`uv build` builds the engine's wheel (`src/disk_tree`; CLI only); there is no release workflow.
`dt-cloud` (`cloud/`) is a workspace member installed from the lock, not published.

## Data Flow

1. `disk-tree index /path` runs `gfind` or `aws s3 ls` (`capture` / `bulk-list` → `import` for the
   split and bulk pipelines)
2. Output parsed into DataFrame, aggregated by directory
3. Saved as Parquet, metadata recorded in SQLite
4. `dt-cloud path-index` / `disk-tree tiers` cut the path store; `dt-cloud index-sync` publishes its
   footers to D1
5. `site/`'s Pages Functions read the path store (row-group range reads) and render treemaps / diffs

## Config

Default paths (override with `DISK_TREE_ROOT`):
- `~/.config/disk-tree/disk-tree.db` — SQLite metadata
- `~/.config/disk-tree/scans/` — Parquet blob storage

**Blob storage is a search path, not a single directory.** The DB stays on the boot disk (small, always mounted); blobs may live anywhere on `config.scan_read_dirs()`, since `Scan.blob` holds a basename. Creating `<volume>/disk-tree/scans` on an external volume opts it in — no config needed — and it becomes the *write* target while mounted; unplugging simply drops it out of the search path. `DISK_TREE_SCAN_DIRS` (colon-separated, priority order) overrides discovery, and an explicit `DISK_TREE_ROOT` disables it entirely so tests and alternate profiles stay self-contained. A candidate under an unmounted `/Volumes/<name>` is never written to — that would silently create the directory on the boot disk.

A search-path entry may also be an **fsspec URL** (`r2://bucket/prefix`, `s3://…`, `gs://…`) — the remote-target story for a boot disk too full to hold scan output (spec `remote-scan-targets.md`). `index --to <url>` (or `DISK_TREE_REMOTE_SCAN_TARGET` + `-R`) writes a scan's blob there, and reads resolve it through the same search path — local dirs are checked first, so a local blob never costs a round-trip. `r2://` rides s3fs with the bucket's endpoint from `DISK_TREE_R2_ENDPOINT_URL` or its `buckets.yml` entry. Every parquet blob read/write goes through `blobfs.py` (the local-vs-URL seam); the reclaim sidecar and `--extents` are local-only and skip remote blobs. The shallow sidecar (`<root-stem>.shallow.parquet`, each chunk's top level, written by every hybrid save) follows the blob anywhere, and scan blobs are written in 64K-row groups so a `depth`/`path` pushdown over R2 fetches kilobytes.

**Cross-account credentials** — a `buckets.yml` entry (or `defaults`) may carry a `profile:` naming an AWS credential profile (`blobfs.bucket_profile`), so a source and a target in *different* accounts each authenticate with their own key inside one `index --to` run. It threads to every S3/R2 seam: the `s3fs` blob IO (`_s3fs(endpoint, profile)`), the `aws`-CLI lister (`S3Backend(profile=…)`), and the `boto3` bulk lister (`S3BulkLister(profile=…)`, `bulk-list -f`). No profile → ambient credentials (env / default profile), the single-account default. Cross-account needs per-bucket endpoints too, so leave `DISK_TREE_R2_ENDPOINT_URL` unset (it globally overrides all per-bucket endpoints).

- `disk-tree scans dirs` — show the write target and every read dir, with blob counts (URL entries show reachability)
- `disk-tree scans move [DEST]` — relocate blobs between local dirs (no DB rewrite). Keeps each path's newest scan **and its chunk closure** on the boot disk by default (`-L` to move those too), so browsing the latest scan doesn't depend on the volume being plugged in

Stream-engine tuning knobs (env, all with measured defaults — see the constants block in `find/aggregate_stream.py`):
- `DISK_TREE_FLUSH_ROWS` — output row-group size (read-side: smaller = less fetched per directory browse, bigger footer)
- `DISK_TREE_PARALLEL_FINALIZE_MIN_ROWS` — below this the finalize stays serial even at `-j N`
- `DISK_TREE_SCAN_BATCH_ROWS` — pass-1 read-batch size (partition balance / seek granularity)

## Tests

```bash
pytest tests/                    # engine
cd cloud && pytest               # dt-cloud (same venv; sync with --all-packages first)
```

Test fixtures in `tests/data/` (mock gfind/s3 output → expected parquet). CI and the job images install `--frozen` from the workspace lock (`deploy/sheet-mirror/Dockerfile` is the reference recipe: `uv sync --frozen --no-dev --no-editable --package dt-cloud --extra …` into `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/usr/local`); a plain `pip install .` resolves fresh and ships pins the tests never ran.

## Performance

- Depth column enables parquet predicate pushdown (only load needed rows)
- `StorageBackend.load(path_prefix=)` pushes a subtree restriction down to parquet row-group pruning (rows sorted `(depth, path)`); wired into `du` / `scans` / staged-delete reads
- Denormalized stats avoid parquet reads for the scan list

**Sizes are per-path, not per-extent.** `gfind -printf '%b'` reports blocks allocated to a *path*; APFS clones (reflinks) and hardlinks let several paths share one set of extents, and each linking path is charged the full amount. So a subtree's reported size is an upper bound on what deleting it frees. Measured 2026-08-29: deleting 35 dormant `.venv` dirs totalling 16.9 GiB freed 9 GiB — uv's default macOS link mode is `clone`, so the remainder stayed live in `~/.cache/uv`. Clones are invisible to `stat` (distinct inodes, `nlink == 1`), so inode/link-count bookkeeping catches hardlinks only — and hardlinks are nearly irrelevant here: a census of `$HOME` found `nlink > 1` over-counting just **4.3 GiB of 385.9 GiB (1.1%)**, which is why `%i`/`%n` are *not* indexed. `disk-tree reclaim` (extent intersection, for a custom keep-set) and `disk-tree overcount` (`ATTR_CMNEXT_PRIVATESIZE`, no open per file, for apparent-vs-exclusive) answer the question properly, on demand. The whole-*volume* overcount is free without either — `df` counts shared blocks once, so `apparent_total − df_used` is the number, but only for a scan that covers the entire volume (a subtree's apparent can't be compared to the volume's `df`); for a subtree, `overcount`'s `Σexclusive` is the physical footprint.

## TODOs / Known Issues

- No scheduled/overnight indexing yet
- S3 pagination not explicitly handled (relies on aws cli)
