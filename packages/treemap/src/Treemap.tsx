 * disk-tree's `{ path, size, kind, children }` node share this component.
 *

 * default:
 *   - `colorForCell` — override cell background/text/hatch. Default: an
 *     8-slot categorical hue by top-level index (stable across renders).
 *   - `renderTooltip` — return a React node for the hover/pin tooltip.
 *     Default: label + size (via `formatSize`).
 *   - `renderRollup` — extra row rendered above the map (e.g. team/user
 *     rollup + $/mo). Default: none.
 *   - `renderLegend` — legend row (right side of the crumbs bar).
 *   - `onCellClick` — override the built-in drill-on-branch,
 *     pin-tooltip-on-leaf behavior.
 *
 * Interaction is baked-in but overridable: click a branch to drill; click a
 * leaf to pin its tooltip; Backspace/Escape pops the drill stack; unpin
 * with Escape or an outside click.
