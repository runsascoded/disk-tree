"""Warm the site's caches for a freshly published scan (`dt-cloud warm-cache`).

The site's `/api/subtree` and `/api/diff` are auth-gated, immutable per scan,
and cached in two tiers (colo cache + global KV, `site/functions/_lib/edgeCache.ts`).
The first viewer of a scan would otherwise pay the compute (a root diff is
several seconds; it was 20 s before the batched lookups). So the daily job,
once the scan is servable, replays the requests the home page makes for its
default views — one subtree + the diff span chips (1d/3d/7d/14d/30d, plus the
plain previous-scan pair) each with its `summary=1` twin — at the canvas
widths common laptops and phones produce. The cache keys include the pixel
budget: the client sends `w = ceil(innerWidth / 128) * 128`, `h = round(0.6 w)`,
so warming a width only helps viewers whose window quantizes to it.

Pure planning (`nearest_prior`, `plan`) is unit-tested; `warm` does the HTTP."""
