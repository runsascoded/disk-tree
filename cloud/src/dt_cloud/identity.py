"""Canonical identity map for storage attribution.

Loads ``identities.yaml`` and resolves raw username spellings (Iris job
owners, provenance ``built_by``, ``users/<seg>/`` path segments) to canonical
user ids. The canonical spelling is
:func:`dt_cloud.usernames.sanitize_username` output, so a raw spelling that
sanitizes directly to a canonical id needs no alias entry; aliases cover
everything else.

Ownership has one axis: a person. There is no group/team facet (excised
2026-09-06 — it let most of the fleet sit under a "communal" label with nobody
to sign off on keeping or deleting it).
