"""Incremental GCS usage-log ingest (specs/access-logs-and-cost.md § Productionize).

Google delivers hourly usage CSVs *flat* under ``usage/`` in the log bucket,
with the source bucket as a filename prefix (not a directory):

    gs://<log-bucket>/usage/<bucket>_usage_<YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_SS>_<id>_v0

Each run, per source bucket:

1. list names past the watermark (names embed the log hour and sort
   lexicographically per bucket, so a name watermark is a time watermark);
2. chunk new CSVs into ≤ ``max_chunk_gb`` groups;
3. per chunk: stage to local disk → parse (``disk_tree.access.parsers.gcs``)
   → lossless layer-1a parquet (zstd) → layer-2a agg shard
   (``disk_tree.access.aggregate``) → upload both → advance the watermark.

Chunks are the unit of atomicity: a crash reprocesses at most one chunk, and
re-uploads land on the same object names (idempotent). Google may deliver an
hour's file late; the state keeps an ``ingested_tail`` of recently-ingested
names and each run re-lists from ``LAG_HOURS`` before the watermark, so
stragglers inside the lag window are picked up instead of skipped.

Data-bucket layout::

    access/state/<bucket>.json          watermark + ingested tail
    access/raw/<bucket>/part-<first>--<last>.parquet    layer-1a (lossless)
    access/agg/<bucket>/part-<first>--<last>.parquet    layer-2a (tree shards)
