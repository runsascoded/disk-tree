"""The A.3 gate: DT's `import -e duckdb --label usr` layer-2 (or its `dirs`
tier) a2a against mgu's floor-free path index, one bucket at a time.

Both are one row per `(path, usr)` with descendant-inclusive sums; DT's
paths are relative to the bucket (`''` = root) where mgu's carry it
(`<bucket>[/…]`, the bucket itself at depth 1). Compared columns:

  mgu   b     o        c2 c3 c4                       wts / wb
  DT    size  n_files  sum_storage_class_id_{2,3,4}   mtime_mean

`mtime_mean` is compared to `wts / wb` within two seconds: DT weights the
exact epoch, mgu weights `epoch(created)::BIGINT` per object (rounded), so
a subtree of same-fraction timestamps drifts by up to a second. A class
pivot DT's file lacks (the bucket has no bytes in that class, or no `-p`)
is compared against 0, and said so; mgu leaves an empty pivot NULL. DT's
root is `.`; mgu's is the bucket. `o` also reports Σ(mgu − DT): GCS folder
placeholders (zero-byte objects named `…/`) are objects to mgu and dir
markers to DT, so the sum should equal their count. Two one-sided classes
are counted apart and don't fail the gate: DT emits a dir's own slice even
when it holds nothing (`size` 0, `n_files` 0 — mgu has no row for an empty
slice), and mgu keeps a dir row for an `a//b` name's empty component (DT
collapses `//`). A third class follows from the second: DT folds every
`a//b…` name into `a/b…`, so where a bucket holds both spellings DT's
`a/b` rows carry both sets of bytes and mgu's only the single-slash ones —
every row at or under the collapse of an mgu `//` path is counted apart
(`collapsed_rows`) and compared on neither side.
