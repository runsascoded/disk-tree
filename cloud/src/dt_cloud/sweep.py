"""CoreWeave S3 mark & sweep — plan-driven deletion (specs/cw-sweep.md).

The flow is mark -> plan -> dispatch -> run. A **plan** is a curated list of
prefixes (an admin's explicit choice, assembled from `sweep`-marked dirs); it
replaces gcs's owner==marker attribution slice wholesale — the curated list *is*
the eligibility decision, so none of gcs's classification / vote / owner logic
ports over.

This module (Slice 1) carries the plan model, the CAIOS boto3 client + the
versioning-enabled guard, and the **manifest builder**: it expands a plan's
prefixes into an object-level manifest from the pinned layer-2 parquet (the
canonical per-object scan output at `cw-l2/<date>/<bucket>.parquet`), so a run
only ever deletes what was reviewed. The executor (the boto3 delete loop,
sweep_exec-derived) lands in a following slice and consumes this manifest.

Eligibility is deepest-mark-wins: a key is swept iff its longest matching plan
prefix is a `sweep` prefix (a deeper `keep` prefix carves it back out). The
layer-2 parquet has no ETag, so the run's overwrite guard keys off (size, mtime)
captured here, not a version id.
