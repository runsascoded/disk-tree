"""Sweep executor — dry-run by default (specs/sweep-executor.md phase 3).

Consumes a `sweep manifest` plan dir. Per eligible directory: fresh re-list
(captures generations — the pinned listing has none), intersect with the
manifest, verify `timeCreated` matches (an overwrite since the scan keeps the
object), detect drift (new keys under a swept dir → skip the dir by default),
and — only with ``--for-real`` — issue generation-matched batch deletes.

Every decision lands in a per-bucket log parquet under the plan dir
(``would-delete/`` or ``deleted/``): name, size, generation, decision.
